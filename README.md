# On-the-Fly Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Rapid Time-Extrapolation and Analysis of Cavity Resonances
Code and data for the lossy rectangular cavity case as described in [1].

***************************************************************************
================== Lossy Closed Rectangular Cavity ========================
***************************************************************************
The data "init_data_rect_closed_lossy_f2w3.mat" represents z-directed E field inside entire cavity.

Follow the steps sequenntially to generate the results

1) Open "DMD_rect_entire_cavity_lossy2_TAP.m"
2) Execute the sections sequentially
